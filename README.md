# Phonon_band_structures_in_seconds_with_MATLAB

## Overview

This project explores Phonon band structures using semi-classical physics. It is based upon my Masters thesis where I modelled the Phonon Hall Effect.
Remarkably Hall effect problems can be modelled by 

* Assuming fictitious spring forces between the atoms.
* Solving eigenvalue problems.
* Computing topological constants and phases.

## How to run

* Request a license for MATLAB which is free for academics or offers a trial for individuals.

* You can either test MATLAB online in the browser or follow the graphical install process. Only the standard libraries are needed for this project.

* Save the required functions in the browser or on your local machine and execute a function by typing its name into the command prompt.
